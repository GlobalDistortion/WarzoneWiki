    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
        The warzone wiki is the best website to get the two best builds for the
        modular guns in warzone the game. These are updated every week as new
        guns and patches create new "metas"(meta meaning best build for a gun)
        in the game. Warzone currently has Two Modern Marfare guns as the meta
        right now and the links to both of them are at the top of the page.
